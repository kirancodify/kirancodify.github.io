A technical blog about the things I have learned and developed during my Academics and work. I intend to make this technical blog more fun by adding a story to  each post which gives a gist of the situation where my researched solution was used.I am passionate about coding but there is a ocean out there for me to learn.This blog is just a small gesture of my learning and sharing some challenges I encountered in my coding life!!

Some technical topis that I might blog about are:
* Networking Concepts
* Cloud Computing
* Data Mining
* Internet of Things
* Mobile and Wireless Communication
* Web applications and more !!

I am a great fan of Object Oriented Programming, so the codes I will be using will be of
* Java
* Python
* JavaScript 

I believe that everyday in life is a new experiment out of which you learn something new with each experiement!!
